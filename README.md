TODO: 
- figure out how to put electron-builder in apps/desktop instead of in the root
now electron and electron-builder is installed in the root, eww

- bug/misconfiguration by me: why does build go full turbo if there was a change in "packages/api"? "apps/desktop" has "api": "*" in "dependencies"
