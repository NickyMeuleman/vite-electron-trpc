# Vite Electron React tRPC Prisma

modified https://github.com/cawa-93/vite-electron-builder

leave template repo at that but create repo for own project with:
- Tailwind
- Eslint
- Prettier
- other goodies

Setting up Prisma to work during dev was fine, getting it to work in the compiled version was a painful experience.
